SnowMan Game with Ice cubes.

Random Ice cubes are created randomly on an ice platform. 4 random ghosts move randomly between the cubes. A character controlled by the player using the keyboard, can also move between the cubes and should avoid to be touched by the ghosts. In case of collision with a ghost, it dies and the player loses.

The player’s character can push ice cubes in any direction. The pushed ice cube slides on the board until it collides with another cube or the game border. If it collides with a ghost, the ghost will be pushed in the same direction and smashed between the moving cube and the border or any other cube in the trajectory.

When the player pushes a cube that cannot be pushed, the cube is weakened (fissures appear) on it. If pushed again, more fractures appear and if pushed a third time, the cube is exploded, and the way becomes free for moving objects.

When the player kills all the ghosts, he wins the game.
